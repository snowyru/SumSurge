## Inspiration
Our motivation behind creating this product stems from our desire to drive the adoption of the *Celo blockchain* and *DeFi tools* within the *South African market. We aim to achieve this by leveraging a tool that resonates with users - **mobile games*.

## Functionality
Sum Surge enables users to earn *Celo token rewards* by engaging in an interactive summation game on the blockchain.

## Development Process
In the creation of this game, we utilized the following technologies:
- *Front-end: Wagmi*
- *Front-end: Nextjs*
- *Back-end: Javascript*
- *Back-end: Solidity*

## Overcoming Challenges
Navigating through unfamiliar territory, we, as students, encountered numerous obstacles due to our limited knowledge of blockchain development. From mastering Solidity for contract development to utilizing Remix as our development environment, and integrating wallet interactions on the front-end using Wagmi, we faced a steep learning curve.

## Proud Achievements
Despite the challenges, we take pride in the progress we've made with this project. While it may not have met all our expectations, we acknowledge the journey and growth it has brought us.

## Key Learnings
Our journey taught us the value of patience and the realization that this endeavor marks just the beginning. We see immense potential in the web3 space as a means to foster global economic inclusivity, and we are eager to explore further opportunities within this realm.

## Future Plans for Sum Surge
Our roadmap for Sum Surge involves continuous iterations - building, deploying, refining, and redeploying as we strive to enhance the user experience and expand our impact in the blockchain gaming space.
